- 👋 Hi, I’m @FancyTurt
- 👀 I’m interested in game dev!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++/Unreal Engine as well as how to run a company!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game modding projects as a hobby. It's always been a dream of mine. 
- 📫 How to reach me? Send an email to FancyTurt@protonmail.com or find me on X @FancyTurt
- ⚡ Fun fact: My dog Iroh uses buttons to tell me when he needs something. He's a smart boy!
